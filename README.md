# Titanic Survival Prediction ðŸš¢  

This repository contains a Machine Learning model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The model is trained on the famous [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), which includes information about passengers such as age, gender, class, and other factors influencing survival.  

## ðŸ“Œ Features  

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key survival factors  
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature engineering  
- Machine Learning model training and evaluation  
- Multiple algorithms compared (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
